# Numpy-Basics
You can start with basic Numpy syntax and work on some problems.
##ðŸ“˜ Numpy Tutorial Notebook
###Overview
This notebook introduces fundamental concepts of NumPy, a powerful numerical computing library in Python. The example focuses on computing agricultural yields based on environmental data using NumPy arrays and operations.

###ðŸ“‚ Contents

###ðŸ“Œ Introduction to NumPy

###ðŸ“Š Working with structured data (Temperature, Rainfall, Humidity)

###ðŸ§® Vectorized computations using NumPy

###ðŸŽ¯ Weighted average calculations

###ðŸ§  Basic operations and optimization with arrays

###ðŸ“Œ Example Problem
The notebook processes environmental data from various regions:

lua

Edit
| Region | Temperature | Rainfall(mm) | Humidity(%) |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Kanto  |     73      |      67      |     43      |
| Johto  |     91      |      88      |     64      |
| Hoenn  |     87      |     134      |     58      |
| Sinnoh |    102      |      43      |     37      |
| Unova  |     69      |      96      |     70      |
Using the formula:
yield = temp * w1 + rainfall * w2 + humidity * w3
Where w1=0.3, w2=0.2, w3=0.5

###ðŸ“¦ Requirements
Python 3.x

NumPy

You can install NumPy using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy
###ðŸš€ How to Run
